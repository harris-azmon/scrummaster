# Codebase Audit Report (2025-12-30)

## Executive Summary

This audit was conducted by the `codebase_investigator` agent to assess the maturity and completeness of the Conductor Monorepo implementation. While the architectural foundation (`conductor-core`) is sound, significant gaps remain in the platform adapters (`conductor-gemini`, `conductor-vscode`) and the utilization of core services.

## Scope

- **Core Library:** `conductor-core`
- **Gemini Adapter:** `conductor-gemini`
- **VS Code Extension:** `conductor-vscode`
- **Cross-Platform Config:** `qwen-extension.json`

## Findings

### 1. Conductor Core

- **Strengths:**
  - Pydantic models with Enum-based status fields (`TaskStatus`, `TrackStatus`) are correctly implemented.
  - Prompt templates (`.j2`) are centralized.
  - Unit test coverage is high (100% for modules verified).
- **Weaknesses:**
  - `ProjectManager` ID generation is marked as temporary ("Simple ID generation for now").
  - `TaskRunner` logic (the "brain" of the `implement` loop) is missing; currently, logic resides only in TOML prompts or is unimplemented.

### 2. Gemini Adapter (`conductor-gemini`)

- **Strengths:**
  - Correctly imports `ProjectManager` for `setup` and `new_track`.
- **Critical Deficiencies:**
  - **Mock Logic:** The `implement` command is a stub (`click.echo("Implementing current track...")`) and does not perform any work.
  - **Hardcoded Logic:** The `status` command bypasses `ProjectManager` and reads `tracks.md` directly.
  - **Test Coverage:** Tests only verify CLI exit codes, not the actual side effects (file creation, git operations).

### 3. VS Code Extension (`conductor-vscode`)

- **Strengths:**
  - Correctly configured with `"extensionKind": ["workspace"]` for remote development support.
- **Critical Deficiencies:**
  - **Incomplete Manifest:** Only defines one command (`conductor.newTrack`). Missing `setup`, `implement`, `status`, `revert`.
  - **Placeholder Implementation:** `extension.ts` only shows info messages; no integration with Python CLI or Core.

### 4. Cross-Platform Configuration

- **Status:** Validated. `qwen-extension.json` matches `gemini-extension.json`.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

These findings have been converted into the **"Deep Audit & Final Polish"** track with the following objectives:

1. **Implement `TaskRunner` in Core:** Port the logic from `implement.toml` into a Python class that manages the TDD loop.
2. **Flesh out Adapters:** Update Gemini and VS Code to use this `TaskRunner`.
3. **Finalize `ProjectManager`:** Implement robust unique ID generation.
