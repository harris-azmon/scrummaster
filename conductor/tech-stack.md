# Technology Stack

## Core

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
  - *Rationale:* Standard for Gemini CLI extensions and offers rich text processing capabilities for the core library.
- **Project Structure:**
  - `conductor-core/`: Pure Python library (PyPI package) containing the protocol, prompts, and state management.
  - `conductor-gemini/`: The existing `gemini-cli` extension wrapper.
  - `conductor-vscode/`: The new VS Code extension wrapper (likely TypeScript/Python bridge).

## Architecture Status

- **Completed:** Extracted platform-agnostic core library into `conductor-core/`.
- **Completed:** Aligned Gemini CLI and Claude Code prompt protocols via Jinja2 templates in Core.
- **In Progress:** Development of VS Code adapter (`conductor-vscode`).

## Strategy: Refactoring and Integration (Completed)

- **PR Consolidation:** Merged [PR #9](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor/pull/9) and [PR #25](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor/pull/25).
- **Unified Core:** Successfully refactored shared logic into `conductor-core`.

## Dependencies

- **Core Library:**
  - `pydantic`: For robust data validation and schema definition (Specs, Plans, State).
  - `jinja2`: For rendering prompt templates and markdown artifacts.
  - `gitpython`: For abstracting git operations (reverts, diffs) across platforms.
- **Gemini CLI Wrapper:**
  - `gemini-cli-extension-api`: The standard interface.
- **VS Code Wrapper:**
  - `vscode-languageclient` (if using LSP approach) or a lightweight Python shell wrapper.

## Development Tools

- **Linting/Formatting:** `ruff` (fast, unified Python linter/formatter, enforcing comprehensive rule sets).
- **Testing:** `pytest` with `pytest-cov` (Enforcing 100% coverage for `conductor-core` and 99% for adapters).
- **Type Checking:** `mypy` (Strict mode).
- **Automation:** `pre-commit` hooks for local checks; GitHub Actions for CI/CD matrix (3.9-3.12) and automated monorepo releases (`release-please`).
