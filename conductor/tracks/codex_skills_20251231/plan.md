- [x] Task: Compare current Conductor skill structure with Codex requirements
- [x] Task: Analyze differences between Qwen/Gemini-CLI and Codex skill systems
- [x] Task: Investigate if Codex requires specific directory structure with SKILL.md files
- [x] Task: Test current skills in Codex environment to confirm the issue
- [x] Task: Document findings about Codex skill registration requirements
- [x] Task: Identify specific files and configurations that need modification
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Design and Architecture

- [x] Task: Write failing test to verify new skill structure design (TDD Phase)

- [x] Task: Create detailed architecture for cross-platform skill compatibility
- [x] Task: Define directory structure that satisfies all platforms
- [x] Task: Plan migration strategy from current to new skill structure
- [x] Task: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- [x] Task: Design fallback mechanisms for platform-specific requirements
- [x] Task: Create technical specification for implementation
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 2: Design and Architecture' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Skill Structure Implementation

- [x] Task: Write failing test to verify skill structure compatibility with Codex (TDD Phase)
- [x] Task: Create SKILL.md files with proper YAML frontmatter for each skill
- [x] Task: Ensure each skill follows Codex naming conventions while maintaining Qwen/Gemini compatibility
- [x] Task: Create directory structure for skills if needed for Codex compatibility
- [x] Task: Update extension configuration files to maintain compatibility across platforms
- [x] Task: Implement fallback mechanisms for different platform requirements
- [x] Task: Create platform-specific configuration files if needed
- [x] Task: Implement skill metadata that works across all platforms
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 3: Skill Structure Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Implementation and Testing

- [x] Task: Write failing test to verify skills appear in Codex command palette (TDD Phase)
- [x] Task: Implement the new skill structure for Codex compatibility
- [x] Task: Ensure backward compatibility with Qwen and Gemini-CLI
- [x] Task: Test skill registration in Codex environment
- [x] Task: Verify skills appear in Codex command palette
- [x] Task: Test functionality of each skill in Codex
- [x] Task: Write additional tests to verify cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Task: Implement error handling for skill registration failures
- [x] Task: Create integration tests for skill registration across platforms
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 4: Implementation and Testing' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 5: Verification and Documentation

- [x] Task: Write failing test to verify skills work across all platforms (TDD Phase)
- [x] Task: Verify skills still work in Qwen and Gemini-CLI environments
- [x] Task: Verify skills work properly in Codex after changes
- [x] Task: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [x] Task: Verify code coverage >95% for new implementation
- [x] Task: Document any changes made to skill structure
- [x] Task: Update any necessary configuration files
- [x] Task: Update README or other documentation if needed
- [x] Task: Create user documentation for the new skill structure
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 5: Verification and Documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 6: Final Validation and Deployment

- [x] Task: Write failing test to verify complete solution (TDD Phase)
- [x] Task: Perform end-to-end testing in all platforms (Codex, Qwen, Gemini-CLI)
- [x] Task: Validate that all individual skills are accessible in Codex
- [x] Task: Verify that skill functionality remains intact across all platforms
- [x] Task: Perform performance testing to ensure no degradation
- [x] Task: Create final validation report
- [x] Task: Prepare for deployment to production environments
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 6: Final Validation and Deployment' (Protocol in workflow.md)
