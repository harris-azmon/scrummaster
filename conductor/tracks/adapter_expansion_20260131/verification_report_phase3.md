# Verification Report: Unified Installer

## 1. Environment Detection

- **Feature:** Added `detect_environments` function to `skill/scripts/install.sh`.
- **Logic:** Checks for existence of `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.opencode`.
- **Result:** PASS (Verified via code review).

## 2. Target Support

- **Feature:** `install.sh` supports `--target claude` and `--target codex`.
- **Evidence:** Script `case` statement handles `claude` and `codex` arguments, setting `TARGETS` to appropriate home directories.
- **Result:** PASS

## 3. Installation Flow

- **Mechanism:** Copies `SKILL.md` and symlinks `commands/` and `templates/`.
- **Outcome:** Installs the monolithic `conductor` skill, which delegates to the protocols in `commands/*.toml`.
- **Compatibility:** This aligns with the "Agent Skills" model where the agent reads `SKILL.md` to learn capabilities.

## Conclusion

The `install.sh` script is updated and verifies correct target support for the expanded platform set.
