# Track Spec: Deep Audit & Final Polish

## Overview

This track addresses the gaps identified by the `codebase_investigator` audit. The goal is to fill the implementation holes in the Gemini adapter (specifically the `implement` command) and the VS Code extension, and to finalize the `ProjectManager` logic.

## Requirements

1. **Gemini Adapter Completion:**
    - Refactor `status` command to use `ProjectManager`.
    - Implement the `implement` command logic (calling the core `TaskLoop` or equivalent - likely need to port this from the original `implement.toml` logic into Python).
2. **VS Code Extension Completion:**
    - Add commands for `setup`, `implement`, `status`, `revert`.
3. **Core Refinement:**
    - Implement a robust ID generator in `ProjectManager`.
4. **Verification:**
    - All commands must be functional, not mocks.

## Dependencies

- `conductor-core`
- `conductor-gemini`
- `conductor-vscode`
