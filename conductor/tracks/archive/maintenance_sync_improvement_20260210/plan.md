## Phase 2: Script Consolidation

- [x] Task: Create `scripts/sync_all.py` to orchestrate `sync_skills.py` and platform validation logic.

- [x] Task: Update documentation (e.g., `README.md`) to point to the new unified sync command.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Final Validation
