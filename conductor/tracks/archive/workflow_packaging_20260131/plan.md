# Implementation Plan: Workflow Packaging & Validation Schema (All Tools)

## Phase 1: Inventory and Schema Design

- [x] Task: Inventory current artifact outputs and locations [07cfcbe]
  - [x] Enumerate tool outputs produced by sync scripts and installers [07cfcbe]
  - [x] Capture command syntax per tool (colon vs dash variants) [07cfcbe]
- [x] Task: Design schema format and location [edcd668]
  - [x] Decide JSON/YAML/Markdown canonical format [edcd668]
  - [x] Define required fields, defaults, and examples [edcd668]
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification "Phase 1: Inventory and Schema Design" (Protocol in workflow.md) [fa8ced5]

## Phase 2: Tooling Integration

- [x] Task: Implement schema loader in sync/validate tooling [ce16ec5]
  - [x] Update skills_manifest/sync scripts to read schema [ce16ec5]
  - [x] Add validation for Antigravity global/workspace workflows and VSIX artifacts [ce16ec5]
- [x] Task: Add tests for schema validation [ce16ec5]
  - [x] Fail on missing files, wrong locations, or stale content signatures [ce16ec5]
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification "Phase 2: Tooling Integration" (Protocol in workflow.md) [b732704]

## Phase 3: Documentation and Examples

- [x] Task: Document schema usage and examples [a14237f]
  - [x] Update README and docs/skill-command-syntax.md [a14237f]
- [x] Task: Provide a quick reference table generated from schema [a14237f]
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification "Phase 3: Documentation and Examples" (Protocol in workflow.md) [7a10cb2]
