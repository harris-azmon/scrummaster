# Track Specification: Google Antigravity/Copilot VS Code Plugin Integration

## Overview

This track focuses on researching and understanding what needs to be implemented to make the Conductor VS Code plugin work properly in Google Antigravity/Copilot environments. Currently, the plugin appears installed in extensions, but the slash commands don't appear in the agent chat interface.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Command Integration Research**
   - Research how Antigravity/Copilot integrates with VS Code extensions differently than standard VS Code
   - Document the specific requirements for commands to appear in the agent chat interface
   - Identify any API differences between standard VS Code and Antigravity/Copilot environments
   - Investigate if there are different extension manifest requirements for Antigravity/Copilot

2. **Slash Command Accessibility**
   - Investigate why slash commands (e.g., `/conductor:newTrack`, `/conductor:status`) are not appearing in the Antigravity/Copilot chat interface
   - Document the technical requirements for making commands accessible in the agent chat
   - Research how other extensions successfully expose commands in Antigravity/Copilot

3. **Context-Aware Development Features**
   - Research how context-aware features can be enabled in the Antigravity/Copilot environment
   - Document any differences in how context is handled between environments

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. The research should result in a clear technical plan for implementing the necessary changes
2. The findings should be compatible with the existing Conductor architecture
3. The solution should maintain consistency with the platform-agnostic approach of Conductor
4. Research should consider maintainability and avoid platform-specific code where possible

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A comprehensive report on the differences between VS Code and Antigravity/Copilot extension integration
2. Clear technical requirements for making Conductor commands available in Antigravity/Copilot
3. A roadmap for implementing the necessary changes to support Antigravity/Copilot
4. Documentation of any architectural changes needed to support both environments
5. Identification of potential technical challenges and proposed solutions
6. A list of specific API endpoints or extension manifest changes required
7. Examples or references from other successful Antigravity/Copilot integrations

## Out of Scope

1. Actually implementing the changes (this will be a separate track)
2. Modifying core Conductor functionality (unless research indicates it's necessary)
3. Testing the implementation (this will be part of the implementation track)
4. Deployment and release of the updated plugin
