# Track Plan: Google Antigravity/Copilot VS Code Plugin Integration

## Phase 1: Research and Analysis

- [x] Task: Set up test environment with Antigravity/Copilot to reproduce the issue
- [x] Task: Document current behavior of Conductor plugin in Antigravity/Copilot vs standard VS Code
- [x] Task: Research Antigravity/Copilot extension API documentation and requirements
- [x] Task: Analyze differences in extension manifest requirements between VS Code and Antigravity/Copilot
- [x] Task: Investigate how other extensions successfully expose commands in Antigravity/Copilot
- [x] Task: Identify specific technical challenges and potential solutions
- [x] Task: Conductor - Automated Verification 'Phase 1: Research and Analysis' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Technical Requirements Definition

- [x] Task: Document specific API differences between standard VS Code and Antigravity/Copilot environments
- [x] Task: Document technical requirements for making commands accessible in the agent chat
- [x] Task: Research how context is handled differently between environments
