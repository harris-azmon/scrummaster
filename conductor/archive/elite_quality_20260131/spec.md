# Track Specification: Elite Code Quality & CI/CD Hardening

## Overview

This track aims to elevate the Conductor repository to the highest standards of code quality and automation. We will enforce 100% code coverage, strict static typing using both `mypy` and `Pyrefly`, and comprehensive linting with `Ruff`. Additionally, we will harden the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate releases, testing matrices, and security scanning.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Strict Typing & Linting

- **Mypy Strict Mode:** Enforce `--strict` mode in `mypy` across all Python modules.
- **Pyrefly Integration:** Integrate `Pyrefly` as a complementary type checker, ensuring it runs alongside `mypy` in CI and pre-commit.
- **Ruff All-in-One:** Configure `ruff` with a comprehensive set of rules to ensure consistent style and prevent common bugs.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Implement `pre-commit` to run `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pyrefly` locally before any commit.

### 2. 100% Code Coverage

- **Strict Enforcement:** Configure `pytest-cov` to fail the build if the total project coverage is less than 100%.
- **Justified Exclusions:** Allow `pragma: no cover` ONLY if accompanied by a comment explaining why the line cannot/should not be tested (e.g., specific OS branches).
- **Test Backfill:** Identify and fill gaps in existing tests to reach the 100% threshold.

### 3. CI/CD Hardening (GitHub Actions)

- **Automated Releases:** Implement `release-please` or equivalent to manage versioning and generate release notes automatically.
- **Matrix Testing:** Run the test suite against Python versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
- **Security Scanning:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning (Dependabot/Snyk) and static analysis in CI.
- **Automated Publishing:** Configure CI to package and publish artifacts (VSIX, PyPI) upon tagged releases.

### 4. Documentation & Standards

- **Update Guides:** Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `conductor/code_styleguides/` to explicitly document the new strict typing and coverage requirements.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Build Performance:** Optimize CI workflows to ensure that strict checks do not excessively slow down development.
- **Standardization:** All new code style guides must reflect these strict requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `mypy --strict .` passes with zero errors.
- [ ] `pyrefly` checks pass across the core library.
- [ ] Total repository code coverage is verified at 100% (including justified exclusions).
- [ ] `pre-commit` is installed and successfully blocks non-compliant commits.
- [ ] GitHub Actions successfully run the test matrix and security scans.
- [ ] Automated release workflow is triggered correctly on merge to main.

## Out of Scope

- Rewriting existing functionality unless necessary to achieve 100% coverage or strict typing.
- Implementing UI changes not related to CI/CD feedback.
