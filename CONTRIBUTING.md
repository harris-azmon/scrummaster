### Elite Code Quality Standards

This project enforces the "Elite Code Quality" standard to ensure maximum reliability and maintainability.

#### 1. 100% Code Coverage
- All code in `scrummaster-core` MUST have 100% unit test coverage.
- Use `# pragma: no cover` sparingly and ONLY with a comment explaining why (e.g., OS-specific branches).

#### 2. Strict Static Typing

- All Python code MUST pass `mypy --strict`.
- `mypy` is used for strict type checking and must pass.

#### 3. Linting and Formatting

- We use `ruff` for both linting and formatting.
- The `ruff.toml` defines the project's rule set (based on `ALL`).

#### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

- You MUST install and use `pre-commit` hooks locally.
- Run `pre-commit install` after cloning the repository.
- Commits that fail pre-commit checks will be blocked.
